# Android_pan_zoom_bitmap_view
<p>
Extend android.view.View to show an android.graphics.Bitmap.
</p>

<p>
It supports panning and zooming under touch and/or API control.
It checks the view dimensions in onDraw(), allowing it to automatically respond to changes of view height and width (such as when the android switches between portrait and landscape orientations).
